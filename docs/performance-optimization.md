# Performance Optimization for Java 17 
## Overview 
This document outlines the steps taken to optimize the application's performance using Java 17's enhancements. 
## Build Configuration 
- Updated `build.xml` to set the Java source and target versions to 17. 
## JVM Configuration 
To leverage Java 17's performance improvements, configure the JVM with the following options: 
- Use the G1 garbage collector: `-XX:+UseG1GC` 
- Set maximum GC pause time: `-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200` 
- Enable experimental VM options: `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions` 
- Enable string deduplication: `-XX:+UseStringDeduplication` 
These options can be set in the IDE or deployment environment where the application is run. 
## Additional Notes 
- Ensure that the environment running the application supports Java 17. 
- Regularly monitor performance metrics to fine-tune JVM settings as needed.
